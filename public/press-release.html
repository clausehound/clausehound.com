        <h2 class="entry-title">Cobalt Lawyers acquires Groundworks, offers tech-assisted commercial real estate services</h2>
        <h6 class="entry-title">Toronto, ON - January 31, 2022</h6>
        <p>
          <a class="page-link" href="https://www.cobaltcounsel.com/" target="_blank">Cobalt Business Counsel Professional Corporation</a> (Cobalt) announced today their acquisition of <a class="page-link" href="http://groundworksfirm.com/" target="_blank">Groundworks Commercial Leasing</a> (Groundworks), an Ontario-based law firm that offers commercial real estate leasing services through a team of vetted Canadian legal and lease professionals.
        </p>
        <p>This acquisition combines Cobalt's long standing presence of providing tech-assisted commercial legal services to Ontario SMEs, with Groundworks' commitment to providing high quality work with a fast turnaround time and within budget. Groundworks' services include, but are not limited to, standard lease abstraction services, lease analysis, lease creation and tenant estoppel certificate services. These services now join Cobalt's wheelhouse, and take on the same SME-minded ethos that Cobalt was founded on.</p>
        <p>
        "From early on, our clients expressed their need for more efficient and cost-effective services, and we built deal automation technology to fill that need," says Rajah Lehal, CEO and Founder of Cobalt Lawyers. "Without the technology, we wouldn't be able to provide services to the same caliber that we do."
        </p>

        <p>
        Groundworks has been servicing clients in Ontario for over 6 years, with a commitment to providing value-add work in the most efficient means possible. In prioritizing efficiency, Groundworks has been seen as a pioneer in its industry with differentiators such as being a completely virtual firm, never accepting retainers for services and always striving to make the most of their clients' time. With the acquisition, Groundworks' founder and lawyer, Natalka Falcomer, will be joining Cobalt's team to consult and assist in a smooth transition.
        </p>
        <p>
        Natalka is a lawyer who is deeply committed to increasing access to justice and positively changing the way that the law is practiced and delivered. Her passion to help make legal advice affordable and practical, as well as her desire to give lawyers the opportunity to work in a friendly and flexible atmosphere, led her to found Groundworks Realty Services. Natalka sits on various real estate boards and prop tech incubators, and has recently joined the Ontario Trillium Foundation as Chair of the Granting Committee. For all of these efforts, she's been recognized as Real Estate Professional's Elite 100 and is a sought after panelist and guest lecturer at various law schools and forums.
        </p>
        <p>
        Cobalt's acquisition of Groundworks will allow Cobalt to expand into the commercial real estate industry and integrate its proprietary deal automation technologies into leasing services. With these newfound services, Cobalt now enters the promising PropTech landscape, which according to the  <a class="page-link" href="https://torontoglobal.ca/TG-Blog/February-2021/Introducing-the-2021-PropTech-in-Canada-Report" target="_blank"><i>2021 PropTech in Canada Report</i></a>, "[...] the strong opportunity for disruption is enabling PropTech business models to thrive. The growth and impact of the PropTech sector is leading the way toward a promising and exciting future in a post-COVID Canada."
        </p>
        <p>
        "This is a natural partnership given the quality of service Cobalt Lawyers provides, using innovative processes," said Natalka Falcomer, Founder of Groundworks. "Cobalt has a strong history of providing legal support to SMEs in ways that make sense for their business - creating a one stop shop for anyone looking to set up their small business."
