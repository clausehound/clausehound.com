              Natalka is a lawyer who is deeply committed to increasing access to justice and positively changing the way the law is practiced and delivered. She's volunteered for over four years (and counting) to arm the public with free legal knowledge as the founder, co-producer and host of a legal call in show with Rogers TV (Toronto Speaks Legal Advice).
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior to founding her firm, Groundworks, and joining Cobalt, Natalka worked in poverty law and was asked to help build a private real estate investment company. At the real estate company, she developed and led the leasing and property management divisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Natalka also obtained her real estate sales license and was recently asked to review and provide recommendations for a revision of the Real Estate Institute of Canada's (REIC) courses related to commercial leasing. She is the recipient of the 2015-2016 REIC Education Award, earned a Certified Leasing Officer designation and sits as a Board member on the Toronto chapter. In late 2016, Natalka became a REIC faculty member, after undergoing and successfully completing REIC's rigorous faculty training session.

            <p>
              Her passion to help make legal advice affordable and practical, as well as her desire to give lawyers the opportunity work in a friendly and flexible atmosphere, led her to found Groundworks. For these efforts, she's been recognized as Real Estate Professional's Elite 100 and is a sought after panelist and guest lecturer at various law schools and forums where she speaks about: Groundworks' "lean six sigma" business model; thinking creatively when seeped in the values of a traditional institution; adapting to the changing legal landscape; and the challenges faced by women lawyer-entrepreneurs.
