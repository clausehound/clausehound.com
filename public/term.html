        <p>We are Cobalt (Cobalt AI Inc. a legal technology company and Cobalt Business Counsel Professional Corporation, doing business as Cobalt AI and Cobalt Lawyers, or, collectively, “Cobalt”).  By entering into an engagement with Cobalt Lawyers you (the “Client”) hereby agree to the terms set out herein.</p>


        <p>Our rates are as follows:  $250 per hour for non-rush work; and $350 per hour for rush work (scope and rates provided by email will supersede, but taxes, expenses, and disbursements will always be applied (even if not referenced in the email).</p>


        <p><span class="termUnderline">Use of Technology.</span><br />

        Use of Technology.  Cobalt’s core value proposition is the use of our DealPrep technology (demo available here at https://www.dealprep.co/) to provide a superhuman level of thoroughness in the search, discovery, sifting and synthesis elements of our client tasks.</p>


        <p>While we have confirmed that our technology has adopted security protocols that are at the standard expected for legal work of our nature, we are not responsible for any failures of third party software beyond our reasonable control.</p>


        <p>Tools that we use that are subject to this provision include DealPrep (noted above), Google Mail, Google Drive, Calendly, Digital Ocean, Quickbooks, Mailchimp among other cloud-based solutions. Our fixed pricing and fast processing is made possible by many of these tools, and by deciding to select us as your cloud-enabled law firm, you agree not to hold Cobalt responsible for any breakdown of these technology solutions.</p>


        <p>In the event that there is a software issue we will work together to find a solution.</p>


        <p><span class="termUnderline">Payment Terms.</span> Typically, we request payment upfront. If we proceed without processing payment, then payment is due within 7 days of signing this engagement letter. Any amount due and owing to Company but not paid by the Client by the Due Date will bear interest from the Due Date at the rate of 2% per month or 24% annually, or the highest rate allowed under applicable law (whichever is less), until the outstanding amount and interest thereon are paid in full (the “<span class="termBold">Interest Rate Provision</span>”).</p>


        <p><span class="termUnderline">Urgency Based Billing.</span> Our hourly rate for non-fixed fee items is dependent on the urgency option selected. We may apply a discount if a promotion is in effect. Please note that this where discounts are applied, application of the discount requires that we receive payment in advance or before our due date. No discount is applied for late payment of invoiced amounts beyond sixty days.</span>


        <p><span class="termUnderline">Careful Read-Through with our Client.</span> We're confident that you'll be pleased with our willingness to explain and discuss your legal documentation. During our discovery and review sessions, we perform a read through of documents with our clients (who appreciate this process as it helps to ensure that they are aware of everything in the document that they are agreeing to). For clients that choose to DIY, please make sure you read through our prepared documentation carefully, taking into account the time constraints that were applied to our drafting process. Our client In certain matters, the law society will only allow us to represent one of the parties on the matter. The other party will have to acknowledge for us that this is the case, and that we only represent one of the two of you. This item should be considered in determining who we are entering into a solicitor-client relationship with.</p>


        <p><span class="termUnderline">Negotiations are Outside of Scope.</span> From time to time parties will enter into several rounds of negotiations, sometimes with multiple lawyers involved, and if negotiations commence, negotiated discussions and revisions will be billed at our full hourly rate. A commercial/transaction lawyer will be assigned to your file should any such negotiations arise. If a specialist lawyer is required for negotiations (for example, for matters in dispute), the hourly rate may be increased. Taxes, expenses and disbursements not included. Any government filing fees (this comes up from time to time, e.g. when amending a company's articles of incorporation) are not included in our fees, nor are taxes or expenses that have been approved by you in writing.</p>


        <p><span class="termUnderline">Time-Frame.</span> Cobalt endeavors to turn around a first draft of requested documentation within the time frame specified when booking. If the work required is urgent, and Cobalt has earlier available times, we will move your work up to the first available time.</p>


        <p><span class="termUnderline">Expiration of Quote.</span> Prices are subject to change, and this fixed fee quote is valid for 30 days, after which time we will be happy to provide you with a new quote (if there are any changes to your requirements or to our fees).</p>


        <p><span class="termUnderline">Fees.</span> Our blended rate is based on fees that range from our paralegals and our senior lawyers. Please be advised that charges for services rendered are based primarily on the time expended by lawyers and staff, but also include factors such as complexity, urgency and value received. Please also note that Cobalt reviews its fees annually in February of each year, and that our charge out rates and any other fee arrangements may be revised at that time.</p>


        <p><span class="termUnderline">Change Management.</span> COBALT LAWYERS WILL NOT PERFORM ANY LEGAL SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH THE SCOPE OF WORK WITHOUT EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION FROM THE CLIENT TO DO SO, AND SHOULD THERE BE ANY CONFLICTS OR ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SCOPE OF WORK THAT WOULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL EFFORT BEYOND TIME ESTIMATES, COBALT WILL INFORM THE CLIENT AND WOULD SEEK APPROVAL FROM THE CLIENT PRIOR TO COMMENCING SUCH ADDITIONAL WORK. Whenever possible (i.e other than in situations of urgency), for tasks requested of Cobalt that are not included in the Scope of Work, Cobalt will provide a fee estimate to be approved by the Client in advance of the commencement of such tasks.</p>


        <p><span class="termUnderline">Additional Payment Requests.</span> Payment of Cobalt invoices or prepayment requests can be made by processing of the credit card held on file, or by cheque in favour of COBALT or by direct transfer to the firm's client trust account, the details of which are as follows:</p>

        <p><span class="termUnderline">Termination of Payment Services.</span> The Client has the right to terminate the provision of Cobalt’s services to the Client upon the provision of written notice to Cobalt.

Please be advised that the Client's continuing instructions will amount to the Client's acceptance of the terms of business set out in this Engagement Letter. If the Client decides that it does not want Cobalt to proceed on its behalf in this matter, please inform Cobalt promptly in writing. Upon termination, Cobalt will provide the Client with an invoice for work completed subsequent to its previously issued invoice.</p>

Approval of each invoice is due within seven days of delivery, and invoices will be deemed to be approved if Cobalt does not receive a dispute in writing by the close of such period. Payment of each invoice is due upon approval, and interest on outstanding amounts owing will begin to accrue on a monthly basis at the rate prescribed by the Solicitor’s Act. In the event that Cobalt is required to take action to collect fees that are owed to Cobalt by the Client, the Client agrees to indemnify Cobalt for costs incurred by Cobalt for such collection activities (including Cobalt’s legal costs).</p>
