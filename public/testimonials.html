              "I have been impressed by the approach to teaching, level of diligence and
              startup-friendly pricing I have been able to receive. When getting started,
              Cobalt immediately provided me with access to the Clausehound blog and
              learning library, which was launched and written by the lawyers at Cobalt. The
              materials provided a wealth of knowledge in the form of thousands of answers
              to questions on deal points that other startups, entrepreneurs and business
              professionals had struggled over, that I was able to use as a learning
              resource during our engagement. This made it possible for me to climb a steep
              learning curve briskly, gracefully, and affordably. Cobalt encouraged an
              unlimited number of questions from the moment we first connected and onwards,
              and the learning materials supported that question and answer process
              delightfully."

              question is too small or large of a question. Where work was out of budget for

              ground. Cobalt has walked us through every stage of our company from new

              internal deals and related disputes, to sale of the business. [...] Where we
