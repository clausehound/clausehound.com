        <h5>Fast Review of Large Contracts</h5>
        <p class="commercial-font">
          We understand that reviewing an endless amount of non-disclosure agreements (NDA’s) and master services/software services agreements (MSA’s) can be tedious and time-consuming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cobalt Lawyers licenses <a class="underlined-text" href="https://clausehound.com">Clausehound</a>’s document comparison software in order to efficiently review various agreements, including NDA’s and MSA’s. With the use of Clausehound, Cobalt is able to offer friendly pricing options including success-fee options to businesses with a high frequency of large-size (in terms of number of pages to review) contracts.
        </p>
        <p class="commercial-marg-top">
          Instead of spending time reading, comprehending and revising complex language in such agreements, our clients have used that time for their business and product development initiatives.
        </p>
        <h5>Outsourced In-House Counsel</h5>
        <p>
          Cobalt’s pricing is offered to growth-stage clients, who we provide legal support to for day-to-day activities, at a discounted rate. Any unused hours are always carried forward to future months until the end of the calendar year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our lawyers will provide a quality-control lens on legal documentation sent out or received by our clients, to ensure that they are operating on a sound legal foundation. Ongoing legal attention of this nature would normally be difficult for a growth company without hiring dedicated in-house counsel. Responsibilities under this pricing option include but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Drafting and negotiation of commercial agreements, legal aspects of new sales promotions
          </li>
          <li>
            Reviewing of agreements that our clients have been asked to sign or are issuing to a counterparty
          </li>
          <li>
            Summary legal advice on human resources-related issues and assistance in the drafting or implementation of company employment policies;
          </li>
          <li>Advice on the collection and use of customer information</li>
          <li>
            Company and business formation, administration and governance, and ongoing regulatory compliance
          </li>
          <li>
            Corporate secretarial matters including the drafting and preparation of minute books and shareholder and director resolutions, maintenance of company registers and annual meeting documentation;
          </li>
          <li>
            Legal research on points of law that affect the current or future operations of our clients’ businesses; and
          </li>
          <li>General corporate and commercial legal assistance.</li>
