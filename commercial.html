            (MSA’s) can be tedious and time-consuming.

            friendly pricing options including success-fee options to businesses

            Instead of spending time reading, comprehending and revising complex
            language in such agreements, our clients have used that time for

            to find out more about this pricing option, entitled “Firstpass”.

          <h5>Outsourced In-house Counsel</h5>
          <p>
            Cobalt’s block-fee pricing is offered to growth-stage clients, who
            we provide legal support to for day-to-day activities, at a
            discounted rate.. Any unused hours are always carried forward to
            future months until the end of the calendar year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our lawyers will provide a quality-control lens on legal
            documentation sent out or received by our clients, to ensure that
            they are operating on a sound legal foundation. Ongoing legal
            attention of this nature would normally be difficult for a growth
            company without hiring a dedicated in-house counsel.

            Business Writing - Our Highest Tier of “Outsourced In-house Counsel”
          </h5>
          <p>
            At Cobalt, our entrepreneurial lawyers understand the importance of
            balancing your legal needs with the business goals of your company.
            The Cobalt team of business writers have successfully supported
            businesses in a diversified range of industries with grant
            applications and RFP proposal responses.
          </p>
          <p>
            We offer a gold tier block fee for a hybrid business-legal writing
            service. Customers that select this option will work with our
            lawyers on both contract negotiations, contract management,
            corporate filings and on business writing activities. This service
            is priced similarly to our block fees arrangement in that unused
            hours are always carried forward to future months until the end of
            the calendar year, but also includes a success fee for contract
            negotiations and/or successful RFPs.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are truly aligned with our clients interests under this hybrid
            block-fees/success-fees pricing option.
